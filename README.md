# Godot_VR_physic_body

This is to make a bonework/nimsony physic VR body character system, but also make other active ragdoll game (Ã  la human fall flat, gang beast or totally accurate battle simulator)

it is close to MVP tough as currently an high potential to give motion sickness, so play safe

missing feature:

	Better grabbing - current grabbing of rigidbody has a springy joint with offset
	
	grab point system
	
	hand pose (when we will have an hand model)
	
	demo scene for showcase
		
	slot based inventory
