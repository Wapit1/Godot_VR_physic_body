# Godot_VR_physic_body

This is to make a bonework/nimsony physic VR body character system

it is done the nimsony way which is physics driven (joint between body and hands) instead of bonework kinematic operation and IK

it is currently barely working and as high potential to give motion sickness, so play safe
