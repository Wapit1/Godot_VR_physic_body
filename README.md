# Godot_VR_physic_body

This is to make a bonework/nimsony physic VR body character system

it is done the nimsony way which is physics driven (joint between body and hands) instead of bonework kinematic operation and IK

it is currently barely working and as high potential to give motion sickness, so play safe

missing feature:

	Needs to allow hand rotation

	Have the physic body follow the kinematic body when possible (when not possible either block the player view or snap him back into the physic body)
	
	Have the kinematic body follow the physic body with a smoothed movement and optional FoV vignette

possible improvement :

	better turning option
	
	better grabbing joints and grab point system
